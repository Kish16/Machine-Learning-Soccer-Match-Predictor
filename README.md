# Machine-Learning-Soccer-Match-Predictor
This is a python machine learning program that is trained using previous premier league season data to predict current season match results. A random forest classifier was the algorithm used for this machine learning project. Web scrapping was also used in order to acquire all the past season data from a separate website.
